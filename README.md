# Facebook_ads

In this project, XYZ Company conducts a comprehensive analysis of their 20 Facebook ad campaigns to provide detailed insights to their supervisors and stakeholders. The campaigns are global in reach, targeting diverse audiences. Key attributes such as reach, impressions, frequency, unique link clicks, click-through rate, cost per click, and cost per result are analyzed to assess campaign performance and effectiveness.

Using Tableau software, I visualized the data to highlight important insights. The dashboard showcases various graphs and charts, including bar graphs for reach, line graphs for frequency, bubble charts for click vs. cost per click, pie charts for reach among age groups, and combo graphs for click-through rate vs. cost per result. These visualizations help stakeholders understand the total spending on the campaigns, reach across different countries, least effective campaign, reach among age groups, and the relationship between costs and reach.

The project aims to help XYZ Company make informed decisions to optimize their ad campaigns and reduce spending on underperforming ones. The insights gathered from the analysis will assist company professionals and stakeholders in strategizing and maximizing the effectiveness and cost efficiency of their Facebook advertising campaigns.
